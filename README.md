Homework 2, VBA Scripting

# What this script does
Given a set of stock data, this script will do the following:
  * Pull all unique ticker symobls and copy them to a new column to the right of the data.
  * Calculate the yearly change in price for each stock by subtracting the closing price at the end of the year from the opening price at the beginning of the year.
  * Calculate the yearly percent change using the same data points as above.
  * Calculate the total stock volume by summing all daily volumes associated with each stock.
  * This script will also apply conditional formatting so positive changes in price will show green and negative changes in price will show red. 
  
# Limitations
This script took about 5 minutes to run on the Test Data but took too long to run on the final Stock Data. I decided to kill the program after 2 hours rather than let it continue. 

Therefore, I have included screenshots of the Test Data rather than the final Stock Data. Any feedback to make my code run more efficient would be greatly appreciated!
